# My Linux Configuration Files
This was created for dwm, but can be used with other wm's with a little touching.

All of these files/folders should be in the users home directory (~/) not in a separate folder.

Packages needed for the config files to work:

- xorg-xsetroot
- xorg-xrdb
- feh
- rxvt-unicode (terminal emulator urxvt)
- ttf-ubuntu-font-family (terminal font)

What this config does:

- Change how the urxvt terminal looks
- Switch keyboard layout to colemak on startx
- Set background on startx with feh
- Show the time with xsetroot
