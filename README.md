# My Linux Configuration Files

This was created for dwm, but can be used with other wm's with a little touching.

To start using, run setupArch.sh or setupDebi.sh (no debian setup yet)

----------------------------------------

## What this does

- Installs essential packages needed for the rest of the setup or just nice to have
- Sets keyboard layout to Colemak
- Sets the background on startx
- Downloads and compiles DWM, Dmenu, and Slstatus
- Installs fonts to avoid font errors
- Makes my life easier
